@RewiredChaos,Waiting for someone to save me But everyone just runs away Waiting for someone to change me But no one ever comes I'm breaking down the walls that cage me But nothing ever falls in place Waiting for the end to take me Blinded by the sun,As much as I hated the eating disorder treatment programme I was in back in 2020 I genuinely enjoyed spending time with my fellow patients during the many hours of group therapy we had together. We had a sense of camaraderie I haven't experienced anywhere else.,I can be tired all day long and then magically not be tired at all when I go to bed at night. It doesn't seem fair.,I feel a little sad and hopeless ngl. I can't keep up with my responsibilities. I wish I could give up. I'm tired of being an adult.,I've been walking a lot more than usual this week. I'm trying my best to get more exercise. It's been good. I still haven't been to the gym but getting more steps every day is a good start.,"the worst feeling ever is begging someone to do something with you, and then seeing them do it willingly with others",I've been in life destroying b/p cycles in the past and I'd rather die than repeat that.,I'm going through old pictures of me at my lowest weight and all I can say is that I really miss being thin.,i wanted to study psychology but i have more potential as a patient t,Asking for the bare minimum and still not getting anything in return is exhausting.,"Telling someone who's genuinely struggling, for whatever reason, to get over themselves in an otherwise therapeutic setting is most likely going to discourage them from seeking the help they clearly need. It's not helpful, it's stigmatising.",I cancelled my appointments today. I'm exhausted and I didn't want to go anywhere. I feel like an irresponsible person but I'm choosing to call it self care instead lol,"I had a good appointment with my psych nurse. She made an important phone call on my behalf, we discussed how I've been and now I have to create a weekly schedule but only add positive/fun things to it just to see how it'll make me feel which is a pretty wholesome idea imo ",I might go shopping tomorrow after my appointment with my psych nurse. I haven't bought clothes in ages and I could use some more comfort clothes if I can find any I like especially pants. I want something baggy but still somewhat flattering.,My therapy homework for my next group session is to keep track of everything I do during the day every day for a week including my mood and then see if there are any patterns. It's a lot of work to track everything but it's also quite interesting,

But he disappeared Like she was never worth a goodbye— And now she carries silence Where warmth used to live.,ignore me and I'll forget everything about you.,How can you look at me and pretend I'm someone you never met.,It's scary how people can unlove you like it was nothing.,i believe that people’s actions can make it clear that they have no respect or regard for you‚ regardless of what they say. their actions clearly indicate that they don’t value you. when you notice this‚ take it for what it is. remember‚ actions speak louder than words.,"please get me out of this phase, everything feels so heavy…",a relationship where there's constant reassurance and we both try to settle any little issue before it worsen because we're afraid of losing each other.,in the mood to be cuddled aggressively,having love and softness in your heart is never something to be ashamed of. giving and receiving kindness is what we are here for.,ou'll end up really disappointed if you think people will do for you as you will do for them.

@DeepHydrangeas,I sabotage relationships because I think it's better to do it before they leave me. Because everyone leaves me eventually.,BPD makes me such a pushover. Ill go out of my way to make others happy in a desperate attempt to prevent them from leaving me. Im so easily manipulated bc Im AWARE its happening & I let it bc in my mind if I stand-up for myself itll push ppl away. What a shit existence I live,bpd got me vibing with my demons 24/7,the d in bpd stands for do you still love me,Do you have the 'my emotional roller coaster is on fire and I want to stop feeling every twist and turn' BPD or do you have the 'im numb like tv static and I want to beat the tv with a bat to feel something' BPD right now?,"Life would go on, with or without me.",Lowkey want someone to run me over with a truck just so I can feel something,is somebody gonna match my freak? (they don't call it best pussy disorder for nothing),Bpd is 3rd degree burns. Bpd is being buried alive & forced to breathe in the maggot filled dirt. Bpd is drowning & watching ppl purposefully withhold the lifebouy. Having bpd is considered automatically untrustworthy. Bpd is fighting 4 your life while being considered a monster,I am filled with so much unexplainable and uncontrollable anger. Why am I seeing red? Idk. How do I stop being extremely reactive because of it? Idk. BPD rage is why I isolate and push ppl away. No one deserves to be on the receiving end of an emotion I struggle to contain.,Ppl with BPD get overstimulated. We're feeling + processing several emotions an hour + navigating distressing & cumbersome intrusive thoughts. Rationalizing & constantly being mindful is exhausting. All that inner stimulation makes the outer world an added layer of stimulation,"Just a friendly reminder: while this string of thoughts is a symptom of BPD, there are many other symptoms you have to experience to be considered to have BPD. BPD is not typically diagnosed until after the age of 18. This & other BPD symptoms overlap with other mental disorders","Emotional regulation is a strenuous effort. It's hard to stop yourself from reacting to emotions that go from 0 to 1,000 or from 1,000 to 0. It's hard to process emotions when they cycle too quickly to sit with & understand them. It's hard to reason with irrational emotions.",BPD is brutal bc I'm literally going through the five stages of grief any time someone says goodbye or doesn't read my messages or I think they're mad at me or they don't answer my phone call or they don't say I love you within a couple hours. It's irrational & devastating,If I were to disappear the world would not miss me. I could easily remove myself and no one would notice.,
@prettydepresser,Whenever I feel really tense I just scream 'ONIZUKIIIII' in the voice of this dude and it makes me relax instantly,"Great teacher onizuka being as problematic as it is, is still one of my favorites animes to rewatch.
